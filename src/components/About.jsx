          <h1>Welcome to Dominion Taxidermy!</h1>
          <h3>I&apos;m Matthew, and I&apos;ve been an avid hunter and angler since an early age. That passion continued into a desire to preserve those memories for years to come. I started my education at the Dan Rinehart Taxidermy School, and continued to refine my skills by working underneath experienced taxidermists at a large taxidermy studio based in southeastern Montana. Now located in beautiful Northwestern Wisconsin, I&apos;m excited to be your go-to taxidermist for all your trophy mounting needs!</h3>
